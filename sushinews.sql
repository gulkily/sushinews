Though she had been arguing back and forth with the rebels’ minister of social politics for several weeks, she had made no headway in getting them to back down from their demands.\r\n\r\n“What can I do if they show up here with Kalashnikovs and buses?” she said as she peered through her office window at the children’s rooms across a grassy courtyard. “It’s just us here. How can we fight back? I will be forced to make a quick decision based on what is best and safest for the kids.”\r\n\r\nThe situation at the orphanage is an example of the state of confusion and fear felt by those living in rebel-held Donetsk as the population waits out the Ukrainian government\'s next moves against the separatists. Tens of thousands of eastern Ukrainians with the means to do so have left this city of 1 million, after nearly three months of violent conflict, which has claimed nearly 500 lives. \r\n\r\nOrphanage director\r\nOlga Volkova, director of an orphanage in Donetsk, Ukraine. Anton Skyba\r\nBut for those who are left, there is the anxiety of what comes next. Many say the war in eastern Ukraine has become so confusing for the remaining residents that it’s often difficult to figure out who’s firing on whom and who’s on which side. Some say they feel the rest of Ukraine is ready to forget about them.\r\n\r\nLocals here say there is little information coming out of Kiev about the government forces’ tactics, even as signs of war can be heard loud and clear across the rest of the country. Public transportation is plastered with posters calling for volunteers for the National Guard and donations to support the Ukrainian army. Ukrainian television news channels have long, nightly reports about the fighting in the east, with a heavy emphasis on gains by Ukrainian forces.\r\n\r\nMany people in Donetsk say they feel that war is just around the corner and worry that there’s little they can do to protect themselves. Over the weekend, two outlying districts of the city were bombed, killing more a dozen. The rebels and most locals blamed the Ukrainian army, while the Ukrainian government insisted that the rebels were bombing the cities with Russian-supplied heavy artillery to make the population think it was an order from Kiev to kill them.\r\n\r\nOn July 11 in Mariinka, on the outskirts of Donetsk, heavy shelling from what some claim were Ukrainian forces landed on the concrete apartment blocks of this quiet, working-class city. Six people were killed, and four were wounded. The mortar rounds fell without warning, ripping huge holes into apartments and shattering windows of nearby buildings.\r\n\r\n“Kiev has no more use for us. That’s why they have attacked peaceful people,” said Sergei Koreyenko, 45, as he surveyed the damaged buildings. “People here might have been indifferent to the separatists before, but after this, I heard 500 went and signed up as rebel fighters.”\r\n\r\nEvacuation\r\nSome residents of the Donetsk region board buses leaving for Rostov-on-Don.Maxim Zmeyev / Reuters\r\nA day before the shelling, Mariinka’s boarding school for orphans also received a visit from a group of armed rebels from the Donetsk People’s Republic. The gunmen told the school’s director, Nikolai Mysura, they would shoot him if he didn’t allow them to evacuate his 54 orphans to Russia. That night, Mysura piled the children into a bus and took them to Volkova’s school.\r\n\r\nTogether, Mysura and Volkova now have 128 children housed in the Donetsk facility, a brightly painted yellow campus built in 1959 and recently given a cheery remodel. “We can’t let the militiamen take the kids,” Mysura said, as his eyes filled with tears. “Maybe this is just a PR move for them to show the Russian media that they are ‘saving’ Donbass children. We don’t know.”\r\n\r\nMysura and Volkova’s greatest fear was that the rebels would use the children as human shields in its war with Ukrainian government forces.\r\n\r\nThe rebels visited the orphanage school once before, taking the younger students into a closed room and asking them how the director and her staff treated them. The students later said they were asked, Don’t you want to go to Russia, where it will be safer?\r\n\r\nOrphanage\r\nStudents’ photos with the inscription “Our pride” at Donetsk Boarding School No. 1. Anton Skyba\r\n“We don’t feel in danger here. We are morally and physically prepared to go to the bomb shelter,” said Maria Sigonkova, 17, a student at the school. “We are hoping for the best but preparing for the worst.”\r\n\r\nThe conflict in the region has already ruined Sigonkova and her classmates’ summer, their last one together before going off to college, she said. For the past several years, the group of teenagers had spent a least a week at the nearby Sviatohirsk tourist camps, where they spent lazy days lying in the sun and hanging out with friends from other regional schools at the resort town, renowned for its mineral baths and historic monastery.\r\n\r\nBut the rebels told the director that they would block the students from going on this year’s scheduled June 18 trip. So for the time being, they are stuck together on campus, making the best of it, Sigonkova said.\r\n\r\n“We stood up to those rebels the first time they came here and told them that we weren’t going with them to Russia,” said Sveta Surchilova, 18. She said none of the orphans would be getting on a bus to Russia. In the end, however, the director will likely decide what the students will do if the rebels show up again.\r\n\r\n“We think the rebels want to show that only Russia cares for us and not Ukraine,” said Nastya Kasumova, 18, the school’s student-body president. “But actually, they don’t care for us at all. They are just using us as a political tool. We’re big kids, you know. We understand a lot about what’s going on here.”\r\n',	'As eastern Ukraine siege continues, 120 children threatened by rising violence and rebels ordering them to go to Russia\r\n',	'2014-07-17 05:27:20',	NULL,	NULL,	NULL),

Many in the armed insurgency are known to be Russian nationals, but Moscow says they are simply citizens who went to fight in Ukraine on their own.\r\n\r\nDefense Minister Valeriy Heletey said the downed plane was flying at an altitude of about 21,300 feet, which he said was too high to be reached with the weapons used by the separatists. Rebels are known to have Igla portable surface-to-air missiles, which work up to about 11,480 feet.\r\n\r\nUkraine\'s Security Council spokesman Andrei Lysenko said that according to information from crew members who the defense ministry says survived the attack, the rocket was either a surface-to-air Pantsir missile or a missile fired by a plane from Russia\'s Millerovo Air Force base.\r\n\r\nIn London, Charles Heyman, a defense analyst who is editing a book called \"Armed Forces of the European Union,\" said the missile was more likely fired by the Ukrainian rebels.\r\n\r\n\"I doubt the transport plane was flying at 6,500 meters [21,300 feet]. That doesn\'t make sense. The higher you fly, the more it costs, and the plane would have had to be pressurized,\" Heyman said. \"It was probably shot down using SAM-6 missiles owned by the rebels, which they have quite a few of.\"\r\n\r\nFighting intensified around Luhansk, meanwhile, as government forces stepped up efforts to disrupt rebel lines and reclaim more territory.\r\n\r\nThe Defense Ministry said Monday that government troops had retaken several villages around Luhansk — including Metalist, Oleksandrivsk, Bile and Rozkishne — and had reopened a corridor to its civilian airport. Those areas are north, west and south of the city, suggesting the government\'s plan to form a security cordon around Luhansk is yielding results.\r\n\r\nOne Luhansk resident named Sergei told The Associated Press that panic had gripped the city Monday over reports that Ukrainian paratroopers were slipping in and detaining rebel fighters. Exit points from the city have been blocked and militia member were confiscating cars and belongings from residents attempting to flee, he said, declining to give his last name due to fears of reprisal.\r\n\r\nA spokeswoman for the separatist Luhansk People\'s Republic told the AP that the group destroyed a Ukrainian armed convoy in the village of Heorhiivka, killing at least three Ukrainian soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible to immediately verify the claim.\r\n\r\nUkraine\'s authorities insisted again that Russia was directly supporting the separatist insurgency now dragging into its fourth month.\r\n\r\n\"In the last three days, Ukraine\'s armed forces have been attacked with Russian multiple-rocket launchers,\" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Monday at a meeting with top security officials.\r\n\r\nMoscow, in turn, accuses Ukraine of spreading the unrest to its own territory.

Speaking with Swiss President Didier Burkhalter, chairman of the OSCE, Lavrov called for the resumption of talks to negotiate a cease-fire.\r\n\r\nUkraine\'s president had a unilateral 10-day cease-fire but abandoned it when rebels would not lay down their arms and return captured border posts.\r\n',	'Ukrainian rebels claim responsibility for downing the plane, but government officials blame Russia\r\n',	'2014-07-17 05:38:20',	NULL,	NULL,	NULL),

Now Facebook, the most popular social media platform, is falling out of favor. Perhaps taking a cue from other social networks — see Twitter’s 2012 purchase of the video service Vine — Facebook has gone on a spending spree to acquire smaller social networks. As a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to escape Facebook’s octopus reach. As the site grows more bloated with new features to keep users engaged, Facebook proves itself both undefeated and desperate.\r\n\r\n“Facebook is still by far the most popular social media channel. However, many … are getting tired of the spam posts, political posts and targeted messaging they didn’t ask for in their feed,” said Jennifer Abernethy, CEO of the media consulting company Socially Delivered and author of “The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Social Media Marketing.” “They want a curated experience.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like the way Facebook makes me feel,” said Dylan Moore, 27, a writer and publisher from Maine. “Everyone’s trying to grab your attention or evoke a response.”\r\n\r\nMitu Khandaker-Kokoris, a 30-year-old game developer from the U.K. who has been logging onto Facebook for seven years, says she has a conflicted relationship with the social network.\r\n\r\n“While it does keep me feeling connected to people I know and wouldn’t otherwise see, it’s obviously problematic in its attitude toward privacy,” she said. “Realistically, I couldn’t imagine myself leaving Facebook completely, though I have definitely found myself using it less — or, rather, I’ve been posting less. I’ve probably still been using it just as much to read others’ updates.”\r\n\r\nFor Oscar Madrigal, a Los Angeles–based writer in his 30s, it’s getting harder to differentiate between real posts and blended-in ads.

He was proud to show off his unit\'s most prized possession -- a truck-mounted anti-aircraft unit that was Russian-made.\r\n\r\nHe told us the weapon had been seized from a Ukrainian base.\r\n\r\nA few miles away, in the town of Kramatorsk, rebel fighters displayed two combat engineering tanks they said they had seized them from a local factory. Eastern Ukraine has long been a center of weapons production. They had parked one of the tanks next to the town square.\r\n\r\nThese were just two instances of how the rebels in eastern Ukraine were steadily adding more sophisticated weapons to their armory, including tanks, multiple rocket launchers -- and anti-aircraft systems.\r\n\r\nIn early June, they began to target Ukrainian planes and helicopters, with some success.\r\n\r\nThe day after we met the commander in the pine woods, an Antonov AN-26 transport plane was brought down over nearby Slovyansk.\r\n\r\nSeveral Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters were also hit in this period, as was an Ilyushin IL-76 cargo plane near Luhansk -- it is about the size of a passenger jet.\r\n\r\nForty-nine military personnel were killed when the IL-76 crashed short of the airport.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, these aircraft were flying at relatively low altitudes, and were targeted by shoulder-launched SA-7 missiles and anti-aircraft guns. The pro-Russian rebels had taken control of several Ukrainian military depots and bases and stripped them of their weapons.\r\n\r\nThe SA-7 was standard Soviet issue. Relatively easy to operate, it is effective to altitudes of some 2,500 meters (8,000 feet).\r\n\r\nBut it and ZU 23-2 anti-aircraft batteries, which rebel units also obtained, are a world away from the SA-11 or \"Buk\" system that seems increasingly likely to have been used to shoot down Flight MH17 on Thursday.\r\n\r\nStealing a Buk\r\n\r\nCould the pro-Russian rebels have acquired a serviceable Buk from a Ukrainian base and operated it? The evidence is circumstantial; a great deal of Ukrainian military hardware is in poor condition or redundant.\r\n\r\nBut on June 29, rebels raided the Ukrainian army\'s A-1402 missile facility near Donetsk. Photographs show them examining what they found.\r\n\r\nThe Russian website Vosti ran an article the same day titled \"Skies of Donetsk will be defended by surface-to-air missile system Buk.\"\r\n\r\nThe article claimed: \"The anti-air defense point is one of the divisions of the missile corps and is equipped with motorized \"Buk\" anti-aircraft missile systems.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Felstead, an expert on former Soviet military hardware at Janes IHS, says that \"the Buk is in both the Russian and Ukrainian inventories, but it\'s unclear whether the one suspected in the shoot-down was taken by rebels when they overran a Ukrainian base, or was supplied by Russia.\"\r\n\r\nHe told CNN that the Buk \"would normally operate with a separate radar that picks up the overall air picture. This was almost certainly not the case with MH17,\" making it more difficult to identify the target and track its course.\r\nEntire family killed in MH17 crash\r\nBodies being taken from crash site\r\nDutch PM demands access to MH17 scene\r\n\r\nAmong the pro-Russian rebels are fighters who served in the Russian army. It is possible that some were familiar with the Buk, but Felstead agrees with the U.S. and Ukrainian assessment that Russian expertise would have been needed to operate it.\r\n\r\n\"The system needs a crew of about four who know what they\'re doing. To operate the Buk correctly, Russian assistance would have been required unless the rebel operators were defected air defense operators - which is unlikely.\"\r\n\r\nIt is now the \"working theory\" in the U.S. intelligence community that the Russian military supplied a Buk surface-to-air missile system to the rebels, a senior US defense official told CNN Friday.\r\n\r\nRussia has denied that any equipment in service with the Russian armed forces has crossed the border into Ukraine. And Aleksander Borodai, the self-described prime minister of the Donetsk People\'s Republic, said Saturday his forces did not have weapons capable of striking an aircraft at such a high altitude.\r\n\r\nBut someone in the border region where eastern Ukraine meets Russia has been using an advanced anti-air missile system.\r\n\r\nLate Wednesday, the day before MH17 was presumably hit, a Ukrainian air force Sukhoi Su-25 combat jet was shot down close to the border with Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry told CNN that the plane was flying at 6,200-6,500 meters (about 21,000 feet) and was hit near a town called Amvrosiivka, which is only some 30 kilometers (20 miles) from where MH17 was hit and 15 kilometers (10 miles) from the border with Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian military alleged the missile had been fired from Russian territory. It was the first time that a combat jet flying at high speed had been hit and came two days after an AN-26 -- flying at a similar altitude in the same area -- was shot down further north, in the Luhansk area.\r\n\r\nSmuggling on the black roads\r\n\r\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Friday that weapons could not be smuggled across the border \"secretly.\" But they can.\r\n\r\nBy early June, rebels controlled several crossings along a stretch of border more than 200 kilometers (125 miles) long. The border area is open farmland that was neither patrolled regularly nor even marked in many places.\r\n\r\nDozens of unmonitored tracks known as black roads -- because they have been used for smuggling -- cross the border. Additionally, the Ukrainian border guard service was in disarray after an attack on its command center in Luhansk early in June.\r\n\r\nOn the road east toward the border through the town of Antratsyt there was no sign of a Ukrainian military or police presence. The pro-Russian rebels had already begun to bring across heavy weapons at that point.\r\n\r\nA CNN team visited the border post at Marynivka in June, soon after a five-hour firefight involving border guards and members of the self-declared Vostok battalion of rebels who had been trying to bring over two Russian armored personnel carriers.\r\n\r\nThey had been abandoned during the battle.\r\n\r\nThe unknowns are these: Just how much weaponry has been brought in from Russia, how was it obtained, and did it include the SA-11 Buk?\r\n\r\nIn June, the U.S. State Department claimed that three T-64 tanks, several rocket launchers and other military vehicles had crossed the Russian border. Ukraine made similar accusations, saying the weapons had gone to Snezhnoe, a rebel stronghold close to where MH17 came down.\r\n\r\nThe State Department said the tanks had been in storage in south-west Russia, suggesting collusion between the Russian authorities -- at some level -- and the rebels. It said at the time that the equipment held at the storage site also included \"multiple rocket launchers, artillery, and air defense systems.\"\r\n\r\nIt added, notably, that \"more advanced air defense systems have also arrived at this site.\"\r\n\r\nMoscow rejected the claims as fake.\r\n\r\nNATO has also released satellite images which, it said, showed tanks in the Rostov-on-Don region in Russia early in June, before they were taken to eastern Ukraine. The tanks had no markings.\r\n\r\nEven so, some experts, such as Mark Galeotti at New York University\'s Center for Global Affairs, say the evidence is largely circumstantial. NATO\'s images did not show the tanks actually crossing into Ukraine.\r\n\r\nWherever they came from, Russian language websites soon featured calls for people with military skills to call a number associated with the separatist Donetsk People\'s Republic if they could help operate or maintain the tanks.\r\n\r\nOne answered, \"I served in the military engineering academy...and am a former commander in the intelligence.\"\r\n\r\nBut the separatists\' greatest vulnerability was always from the air.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainians had already shown, in driving them away from the Donetsk airport at the end of May, that they could use airpower to devastating effect. And they had begun to fly at higher altitudes to avoid shoulder-launched missiles.\r\n\r\nTo hold what remained of their territory, the pro-Russian rebels needed to be able to challenge Ukrainian dominance of the skies.\r\n\r\nWhether they received help from across the border to do so, and in what way, is the question that governments around the world want answered.',	'Whether they received help from across the border to do so, and in what way, is the question that governments around the world want answered.',	'2014-07-20 14:00:38',	NULL,	NULL,	NULL),

The U.S. has imposed restrictions on exports to Russia that could be used in weaponry, but the EU has yet to take such an action.\r\n\r\nThe bloc\'s 28 foreign ministers will almost certainly discuss that question Tuesday, but a final decision would have to be made by EU leaders. Many countries fear retaliation from Moscow should they adopt broader sanctions. It is not yet clear if the anger over the plane crash can overcome those reservations.\r\n\r\nEuropean leaders were already frustrated before the crash by what they saw as Russian intransigence on Ukraine. Last Wednesday, they agreed to broaden sanctions to potentially anyone supporting Russian decision makers involved in the Ukraine conflict, and directed EU staff to draw up a list of people and entities to be sanctioned by the end of July.\r\n\r\nOfficials in several European capitals said the plane crash added a new sense of urgency to drawing up that list, which is also expected to be discussed by EU foreign ministers on Tuesday. But the officials cautioned that the process of drafting the list could take time, given the legal complexity of connecting business entities to events in Ukraine.\r\n\r\n— Stacy Meichtry in Paris, Deborah Ball in Rome and James Marson in Moscow contributed to this article.',	'U.S. intelligence assessments indicate that Moscow likely provided the pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine with sophisticated antiaircraft systems in recent days, matching evidence put forward by Ukraine and bolstering charges that Russia was the source of the weapon that shot down the airliner, killing 298.\r\n',	'2014-07-20 15:08:13',	NULL,	NULL,	NULL),
