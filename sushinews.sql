Obama said the United States could impose further sanctions if Russia did not take concrete steps to ease the conflict.\r\n\r\nIn his harshest words yet about future ties with Washington, Putin on Thursday said the sanctions would damage U.S. energy companies and bring relations to a \"dead end.\" A Foreign Ministry official said Moscow would hit back in a way that would be \"painful\" for Washington.\r\n\r\nThe White House announcement deepened the most serious standoff between Moscow and the West since the end of the Cold War, as fighting between the Kiev government forces and pro-Russian separatists threatens to escalate into all-out civil war.\r\n\r\nThe targeted companies, run by President Vladimir Putin\'s allies — many of whom have become wealthy during his tenure — also include Novatek, Russia\'s second-largest gas producer, Vnesheconombank, or VEB, a state-owned bank that acts as payment agent for the Russian government, and eight arms firms, eight arms firms, including the producer of the Kalashnikov assault rifle.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Treasury Department, which posted the sanctions on its website, said the measures effectively closed medium- and long-term dollar funding to the two banks and energy companies.\r\n\r\nBut the sanctions did not freeze the assets of those four companies or stop U.S. firms from doing business with them and several were quick to say it was business as usual.

Just two days ago, nine civilians were killed in heavy mortar fire in the nearby city of Petrovka, just 12 miles from the center of Donetsk.\r\n\r\nOn the other, there is the even more immediate issue of the pro-Moscow rebels, who yesterday ordered the director to prepare the more than 120 orphans in her charge for immediate evacuation to Russia.\r\n\r\nThe rebels said they would arrive at the school with enough buses to take the orphans across the border. By order of the Donetsk’s People Republic, she must have the children, ranging in age from 7 to 18, packed and ready to go when the buses arrive — or else.\r\n\r\nVolkova shook her head as she described how helpless she felt in the situation. Though she had been arguing back and forth with the rebels’ minister of social politics for several weeks, she had made no headway in getting them to back down from their demands.\r\n\r\n“What can I do if they show up here with Kalashnikovs and buses?” she said as she peered through her office window at the children’s rooms across a grassy courtyard. “It’s just us here. How can we fight back? I will be forced to make a quick decision based on what is best and safest for the kids.”\r\n\r\nThe situation at the orphanage is an example of the state of confusion and fear felt by those living in rebel-held Donetsk as the population waits out the Ukrainian government\'s next moves against the separatists. Tens of thousands of eastern Ukrainians with the means to do so have left this city of 1 million, after nearly three months of violent conflict, which has claimed nearly 500 lives. \r\n\r\nOrphanage director\r\nOlga Volkova, director of an orphanage in Donetsk, Ukraine. Anton Skyba\r\nBut for those who are left, there is the anxiety of what comes next. Many say the war in eastern Ukraine has become so confusing for the remaining residents that it’s often difficult to figure out who’s firing on whom and who’s on which side. Some say they feel the rest of Ukraine is ready to forget about them.\r\n\r\nLocals here say there is little information coming out of Kiev about the government forces’ tactics, even as signs of war can be heard loud and clear across the rest of the country. Public transportation is plastered with posters calling for volunteers for the National Guard and donations to support the Ukrainian army. Ukrainian television news channels have long, nightly reports about the fighting in the east, with a heavy emphasis on gains by Ukrainian forces.\r\n\r\nMany people in Donetsk say they feel that war is just around the corner and worry that there’s little they can do to protect themselves. Over the weekend, two outlying districts of the city were bombed, killing more a dozen. The rebels and most locals blamed the Ukrainian army, while the Ukrainian government insisted that the rebels were bombing the cities with Russian-supplied heavy artillery to make the population think it was an order from Kiev to kill them.\r\n\r\nOn July 11 in Mariinka, on the outskirts of Donetsk, heavy shelling from what some claim were Ukrainian forces landed on the concrete apartment blocks of this quiet, working-class city. Six people were killed, and four were wounded. The mortar rounds fell without warning, ripping huge holes into apartments and shattering windows of nearby buildings.\r\n\r\n“Kiev has no more use for us. That’s why they have attacked peaceful people,” said Sergei Koreyenko, 45, as he surveyed the damaged buildings. “People here might have been indifferent to the separatists before, but after this, I heard 500 went and signed up as rebel fighters.”\r\n\r\nEvacuation\r\nSome residents of the Donetsk region board buses leaving for Rostov-on-Don.Maxim Zmeyev / Reuters\r\nA day before the shelling, Mariinka’s boarding school for orphans also received a visit from a group of armed rebels from the Donetsk People’s Republic. The gunmen told the school’s director, Nikolai Mysura, they would shoot him if he didn’t allow them to evacuate his 54 orphans to Russia. That night, Mysura piled the children into a bus and took them to Volkova’s school.\r\n\r\nTogether, Mysura and Volkova now have 128 children housed in the Donetsk facility, a brightly painted yellow campus built in 1959 and recently given a cheery remodel. “We can’t let the militiamen take the kids,” Mysura said, as his eyes filled with tears. “Maybe this is just a PR move for them to show the Russian media that they are ‘saving’ Donbass children. We don’t know.”\r\n\r\nMysura and Volkova’s greatest fear was that the rebels would use the children as human shields in its war with Ukrainian government forces.\r\n\r\nThe rebels visited the orphanage school once before, taking the younger students into a closed room and asking them how the director and her staff treated them. The students later said they were asked, Don’t you want to go to Russia, where it will be safer?\r\n\r\nOrphanage\r\nStudents’ photos with the inscription “Our pride” at Donetsk Boarding School No. 1. Anton Skyba\r\n“We don’t feel in danger here. We are morally and physically prepared to go to the bomb shelter,” said Maria Sigonkova, 17, a student at the school. “We are hoping for the best but preparing for the worst.”\r\n\r\nThe conflict in the region has already ruined Sigonkova and her classmates’ summer, their last one together before going off to college, she said. For the past several years, the group of teenagers had spent a least a week at the nearby Sviatohirsk tourist camps, where they spent lazy days lying in the sun and hanging out with friends from other regional schools at the resort town, renowned for its mineral baths and historic monastery.\r\n\r\nBut the rebels told the director that they would block the students from going on this year’s scheduled June 18 trip. So for the time being, they are stuck together on campus, making the best of it, Sigonkova said.\r\n\r\n“We stood up to those rebels the first time they came here and told them that we weren’t going with them to Russia,” said Sveta Surchilova, 18. She said none of the orphans would be getting on a bus to Russia.

Many in the armed insurgency are known to be Russian nationals, but Moscow says they are simply citizens who went to fight in Ukraine on their own.\r\n\r\nDefense Minister Valeriy Heletey said the downed plane was flying at an altitude of about 21,300 feet, which he said was too high to be reached with the weapons used by the separatists. Rebels are known to have Igla portable surface-to-air missiles, which work up to about 11,480 feet.\r\n\r\nUkraine\'s Security Council spokesman Andrei Lysenko said that according to information from crew members who the defense ministry says survived the attack, the rocket was either a surface-to-air Pantsir missile or a missile fired by a plane from Russia\'s Millerovo Air Force base.\r\n\r\nIn London, Charles Heyman, a defense analyst who is editing a book called \"Armed Forces of the European Union,\" said the missile was more likely fired by the Ukrainian rebels.\r\n\r\n\"I doubt the transport plane was flying at 6,500 meters [21,300 feet]. That doesn\'t make sense. The higher you fly, the more it costs, and the plane would have had to be pressurized,\" Heyman said. \"It was probably shot down using SAM-6 missiles owned by the rebels, which they have quite a few of.\"\r\n\r\nFighting intensified around Luhansk, meanwhile, as government forces stepped up efforts to disrupt rebel lines and reclaim more territory.\r\n\r\nThe Defense Ministry said Monday that government troops had retaken several villages around Luhansk — including Metalist, Oleksandrivsk, Bile and Rozkishne — and had reopened a corridor to its civilian airport. Those areas are north, west and south of the city, suggesting the government\'s plan to form a security cordon around Luhansk is yielding results.\r\n\r\nOne Luhansk resident named Sergei told The Associated Press that panic had gripped the city Monday over reports that Ukrainian paratroopers were slipping in and detaining rebel fighters. Exit points from the city have been blocked and militia member were confiscating cars and belongings from residents attempting to flee, he said, declining to give his last name due to fears of reprisal.\r\n\r\nA spokeswoman for the separatist Luhansk People\'s Republic told the AP that the group destroyed a Ukrainian armed convoy in the village of Heorhiivka, killing at least three Ukrainian soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible to immediately verify the claim.\r\n\r\nUkraine\'s authorities insisted again that Russia was directly supporting the separatist insurgency now dragging into its fourth month.\r\n\r\n\"In the last three days, Ukraine\'s armed forces have been attacked with Russian multiple-rocket launchers,\" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Monday at a meeting with top security officials.\r\n\r\nMoscow, in turn, accuses Ukraine of spreading the unrest to its own territory. Russian media reported Sunday that a Ukrainian shell had hit a building in a Russian border town, killing one person and seriously injuring two others.\r\n\r\nUkraine denied that it had fired shells onto foreign soil but Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed \"grave concern\" over the incident and Russia\'s foreign ministry warned there could be \"irreversible consequences.\"\r\n\r\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov sent a letter Monday requesting that observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe visit Russian border towns affected by the fighting. Speaking with Swiss President Didier Burkhalter, chairman of the OSCE, Lavrov called for the resumption of talks to negotiate a cease-fire.\r\n\r\nUkraine\'s president had a unilateral 10-day cease-fire but abandoned it when rebels would not lay down their arms and return captured border posts.\r\n','Ukrainian rebels claim responsibility for downing the plane, but government officials blame Russia\r\n','2014-07-17 05:38:20',NULL,NULL,NULL),(74,0,'a02d6aca31adbfef6335bd51875df5b2','Moscow says Ukrainian shell killed Russian, warns of consequences','Russia threatened Ukraine on Sunday with \"irreversible consequences\" after a man was killed by a shell fired across the border from Ukraine, describing the incident in warlike terms as aggression that must be met with a response.\r\n\r\nAlthough both sides have reported cross-border shootings, the incident appears to be the first time Moscow reported fatalities on its side of the border in the three-month conflict, which has killed hundreds of people in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nKiev called the accusation that its forces fired across the border \"total nonsense\" and suggested the attack could have been the work of rebels trying to provoke Moscow to intervene on their behalf. The rebels denied they were responsible.\r\n\r\nIn Ukraine, where combat has intensified dramatically since a rebel missile attack killed dozens of government troops on Friday, local officials said 18 people were killed in shootings in the two main rebel-held cities.\r\n\r\nKiev said it bombarded a convoy of 100 armored vehicles and trucks that crossed into Ukraine carrying rebel fighters from Russia. It also said seven of its troops were killed in attacks.\r\n\r\nMoscow\'s bellicose response to the cross-border shelling raises the renewed prospect of overt Russian intervention, after weeks in which President Vladimir Putin appeared intent on disengaging, pulling back tens of thousands of troops he had massed at the border.\r\n\r\nRussia sent Ukraine a note of protest describing the incident as \"an aggressive act by the Ukrainian side against sovereign Russian territory and the citizens of the Russian Federation,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement warning of \"irreversible consequences.\"\r\n\r\n\"This represents a qualitative escalation of the danger to our citizens, now even on our own territory. Of course this naturally cannot pass without a response,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin told Rossiya-24 state TV.\r\n\r\nRussia\'s Investigative Committee said a shell had landed in the yard of a house in Donetsk, a small town on the Russian side of the border, killing a man and wounding a woman.

It happened to Friendster. Now Facebook, the most popular social media platform, is falling out of favor. Perhaps taking a cue from other social networks — see Twitter’s 2012 purchase of the video service Vine — Facebook has gone on a spending spree to acquire smaller social networks. As a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to escape Facebook’s octopus reach. As the site grows more bloated with new features to keep users engaged, Facebook proves itself both undefeated and desperate.\r\n\r\n“Facebook is still by far the most popular social media channel. However, many … are getting tired of the spam posts, political posts and targeted messaging they didn’t ask for in their feed,” said Jennifer Abernethy, CEO of the media consulting company Socially Delivered and author of “The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Social Media Marketing.” “They want a curated experience.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like the way Facebook makes me feel,” said Dylan Moore, 27, a writer and publisher from Maine. “Everyone’s trying to grab your attention or evoke a response.”\r\n\r\nMitu Khandaker-Kokoris, a 30-year-old game developer from the U.K. who has been logging onto Facebook for seven years, says she has a conflicted relationship with the social network.\r\n\r\n“While it does keep me feeling connected to people I know and wouldn’t otherwise see, it’s obviously problematic in its attitude toward privacy,” she said. “Realistically, I couldn’t imagine myself leaving Facebook completely, though I have definitely found myself using it less — or, rather, I’ve been posting less. I’ve probably still been using it just as much to read others’ updates.”\r\n\r\nFor Oscar Madrigal, a Los Angeles–based writer in his 30s, it’s getting harder to differentiate between real posts and blended-in ads. But he can’t see leaving Facebook anytime soon.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see [another] platform that brings everyone together the way Facebook does,” he said. “If something else came along, I would consider it.”\r\n','The world’s most popular social media platform is losing favor, but users won’t shut down their accounts\r\n','2014-07-17 05:41:03',NULL,NULL,NULL),(77,0,'41ea303bfea7489a6a1291ec5f3af466','Hamas leadership refuses Egyptian cease fire initiative','Top officials in the Hamas movement, including Khaled Mashaal currently residing in Qatar who leads Hamas\'s political bureau from exile, have rejected an Egyptian-proposed cease fire yesterday between Israel and Hamas, claiming it does not serve their interests.\r\n\r\nThe cease fire supposedly began, as proposed in the Egyptian initiative, at 9:00 yesterday morning local time (0600 UTC), after approval by the Israeli cabinet.

He was proud to show off his unit\'s most prized possession -- a truck-mounted anti-aircraft unit that was Russian-made.\r\n\r\nHe told us the weapon had been seized from a Ukrainian base.\r\n\r\nA few miles away, in the town of Kramatorsk, rebel fighters displayed two combat engineering tanks they said they had seized them from a local factory. Eastern Ukraine has long been a center of weapons production. They had parked one of the tanks next to the town square.\r\n\r\nThese were just two instances of how the rebels in eastern Ukraine were steadily adding more sophisticated weapons to their armory, including tanks, multiple rocket launchers -- and anti-aircraft systems.\r\n\r\nIn early June, they began to target Ukrainian planes and helicopters, with some success.\r\n\r\nThe day after we met the commander in the pine woods, an Antonov AN-26 transport plane was brought down over nearby Slovyansk.\r\n\r\nSeveral Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters were also hit in this period, as was an Ilyushin IL-76 cargo plane near Luhansk -- it is about the size of a passenger jet.\r\n\r\nForty-nine military personnel were killed when the IL-76 crashed short of the airport.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, these aircraft were flying at relatively low altitudes, and were targeted by shoulder-launched SA-7 missiles and anti-aircraft guns. The pro-Russian rebels had taken control of several Ukrainian military depots and bases and stripped them of their weapons.\r\n\r\nThe SA-7 was standard Soviet issue. Relatively easy to operate, it is effective to altitudes of some 2,500 meters (8,000 feet).\r\n\r\nBut it and ZU 23-2 anti-aircraft batteries, which rebel units also obtained, are a world away from the SA-11 or \"Buk\" system that seems increasingly likely to have been used to shoot down Flight MH17 on Thursday.\r\n\r\nStealing a Buk\r\n\r\nCould the pro-Russian rebels have acquired a serviceable Buk from a Ukrainian base and operated it? The evidence is circumstantial; a great deal of Ukrainian military hardware is in poor condition or redundant.\r\n\r\nBut on June 29, rebels raided the Ukrainian army\'s A-1402 missile facility near Donetsk. Photographs show them examining what they found.\r\n\r\nThe Russian website Vosti ran an article the same day titled \"Skies of Donetsk will be defended by surface-to-air missile system Buk.\"\r\n\r\nThe article claimed: \"The anti-air defense point is one of the divisions of the missile corps and is equipped with motorized \"Buk\" anti-aircraft missile systems.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Felstead, an expert on former Soviet military hardware at Janes IHS, says that \"the Buk is in both the Russian and Ukrainian inventories, but it\'s unclear whether the one suspected in the shoot-down was taken by rebels when they overran a Ukrainian base, or was supplied by Russia.\"\r\n\r\nHe told CNN that the Buk \"would normally operate with a separate radar that picks up the overall air picture. This was almost certainly not the case with MH17,\" making it more difficult to identify the target and track its course.\r\nEntire family killed in MH17 crash\r\nBodies being taken from crash site\r\nDutch PM demands access to MH17 scene\r\n\r\nAmong the pro-Russian rebels are fighters who served in the Russian army. It is possible that some were familiar with the Buk, but Felstead agrees with the U.S. and Ukrainian assessment that Russian expertise would have been needed to operate it.\r\n\r\n\"The system needs a crew of about four who know what they\'re doing. To operate the Buk correctly, Russian assistance would have been required unless the rebel operators were defected air defense operators - which is unlikely.\"\r\n\r\nIt is now the \"working theory\" in the U.S. intelligence community that the Russian military supplied a Buk surface-to-air missile system to the rebels, a senior US defense official told CNN Friday.\r\n\r\nRussia has denied that any equipment in service with the Russian armed forces has crossed the border into Ukraine. And Aleksander Borodai, the self-described prime minister of the Donetsk People\'s Republic, said Saturday his forces did not have weapons capable of striking an aircraft at such a high altitude.\r\n\r\nBut someone in the border region where eastern Ukraine meets Russia has been using an advanced anti-air missile system.\r\n\r\nLate Wednesday, the day before MH17 was presumably hit, a Ukrainian air force Sukhoi Su-25 combat jet was shot down close to the border with Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry told CNN that the plane was flying at 6,200-6,500 meters (about 21,000 feet) and was hit near a town called Amvrosiivka, which is only some 30 kilometers (20 miles) from where MH17 was hit and 15 kilometers (10 miles) from the border with Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian military alleged the missile had been fired from Russian territory. It was the first time that a combat jet flying at high speed had been hit and came two days after an AN-26 -- flying at a similar altitude in the same area -- was shot down further north, in the Luhansk area.\r\n\r\nSmuggling on the black roads\r\n\r\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Friday that weapons could not be smuggled across the border \"secretly.\" But they can.\r\n\r\nBy early June, rebels controlled several crossings along a stretch of border more than 200 kilometers (125 miles) long. The border area is open farmland that was neither patrolled regularly nor even marked in many places.\r\n\r\nDozens of unmonitored tracks known as black roads -- because they have been used for smuggling -- cross the border. Additionally, the Ukrainian border guard service was in disarray after an attack on its command center in Luhansk early in June.\r\n\r\nOn the road east toward the border through the town of Antratsyt there was no sign of a Ukrainian military or police presence. The pro-Russian rebels had already begun to bring across heavy weapons at that point.\r\n\r\nA CNN team visited the border post at Marynivka in June, soon after a five-hour firefight involving border guards and members of the self-declared Vostok battalion of rebels who had been trying to bring over two Russian armored personnel carriers.\r\n\r\nThey had been abandoned during the battle.\r\n\r\nThe unknowns are these: Just how much weaponry has been brought in from Russia, how was it obtained, and did it include the SA-11 Buk?\r\n\r\nIn June, the U.S. State Department claimed that three T-64 tanks, several rocket launchers and other military vehicles had crossed the Russian border. Ukraine made similar accusations, saying the weapons had gone to Snezhnoe, a rebel stronghold close to where MH17 came down.\r\n\r\nThe State Department said the tanks had been in storage in south-west Russia, suggesting collusion between the Russian authorities -- at some level -- and the rebels. It said at the time that the equipment held at the storage site also included \"multiple rocket launchers, artillery, and air defense systems.\"\r\n\r\nIt added, notably, that \"more advanced air defense systems have also arrived at this site.\"\r\n\r\nMoscow rejected the claims as fake.\r\n\r\nNATO has also released satellite images which, it said, showed tanks in the Rostov-on-Don region in Russia early in June, before they were taken to eastern Ukraine. The tanks had no markings.\r\n\r\nEven so, some experts, such as Mark Galeotti at New York University\'s Center for Global Affairs, say the evidence is largely circumstantial. NATO\'s images did not show the tanks actually crossing into Ukraine.\r\n\r\nWherever they came from, Russian language websites soon featured calls for people with military skills to call a number associated with the separatist Donetsk People\'s Republic if they could help operate or maintain the tanks.\r\n\r\nOne answered, \"I served in the military engineering academy...and am a former commander in the intelligence.\"\r\n\r\nBut the separatists\' greatest vulnerability was always from the air.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainians had already shown, in driving them away from the Donetsk airport at the end of May, that they could use airpower to devastating effect. And they had begun to fly at higher altitudes to avoid shoulder-launched missiles.\r\n\r\nTo hold what remained of their territory, the pro-Russian rebels needed to be able to challenge Ukrainian dominance of the skies.\r\n\r\nWhether they received help from across the border to do so, and in what way, is the question that governments around the world want answered.','Whether they received help from across the border to do so, and in what way, is the question that governments around the world want answered.','2014-07-20 14:00:38',NULL,NULL,NULL),(110,0,'d6f339aff7116b710ef9c94bf12565c8','European Leaders Threaten Harsher Sanctions Against Russia','European leaders threatened harsher sanctions against Russia on Sunday in the wake of the downing of Malaysia Airlines 3786.KU -11.11% Flight MH17, departing from initially muted tones in reacting to the disaster but leaving uncertainty over how quickly the European Union would be able to make good on its threats.\r\n\r\nMomentum built on Sunday for the European assets of prominent Russian businessmen and companies to be frozen as early as Tuesday, when EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels.\r\n\r\nAnger in EU capitals about the crash, widely believed to have been caused by a missile fired from territory held by pro-Russia rebels in Eastern Ukraine, mounted over the weekend as rebels hindered international efforts to inspect the crash site and recover victims\' remains.\r\n\r\nU.S. intelligence assessments indicate that Moscow likely provided the pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine with sophisticated antiaircraft systems in recent days, matching evidence put forward by Ukraine and bolstering charges that Russia was the source of the weapon that shot down the airliner, killing 298.\r\n\r\nU.S. officials say they suspect that Russia supplied the rebels with multiple SA-11 antiaircraft systems by smuggling them into eastern Ukraine with other military equipment, including tanks.\r\n\r\nFurther, U.S. officials believe the systems were moved back across the border into Russia following the shoot down of the jetliner, buttressing what Ukraine charges is an attempt by the rebels and their Russian advisers to cover up their involvement in the crash.\r\n\r\nOfficials who have been pushing Europe to take a harder stance believe the crash marks a watershed. \"In my assessment, this is really a turning point,\" Lithuanian foreign minister Linas Linkevicius said in an interview Sunday. \"If anyone had the illusion that this was only happening in Ukraine, that it had nothing to do with our common concerns—now we can see all these victims from the West.

Moscow denies involvement and has pointed a finger at Kiev\'s military.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch government, whose citizens made up more than half the 298 aboard MH17 from Amsterdam, said it was \"furious\" at the manhandling of corpses strewn for miles over open country and asked Ukraine\'s president for help to bring \"our people\" home.\r\n\r\nAfter U.S. President Barack Obama said the loss of the Kuala Lumpur-bound flight showed it was time to end the conflict, Germany called it Moscow\'s last chance to cooperate.\r\n\r\nEuropean powers seemed to swing behind Washington\'s belief Russia\'s separatist allies were to blame. That might speed new trade sanctions on Moscow, without waiting for definitive proof.\r\n\r\n\"He has one last chance to show he means to help,\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said after a telephone call to Putin.\r\n\r\nBritain, which lost 10 citizens, said Prime Minister David Cameron agreed with Rutte that the European Union, warier than Washington of hurting its own economy by imposing sanctions, should reconsider its approach due to evidence of rebel guilt. On Friday, Cameron had urged caution before an investigation.\r\n\r\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, the most powerful figure in the EU, spoke to Putin on Saturday, urging his cooperation. Merkel\'s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, told Bild am Sonntag newspaper: \"Moscow may have a last chance now to show that it really is seriously interested in a solution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now is the moment for everyone to stop and think to themselves what might happen if we don\'t stop the escalation.\"\r\n\r\nGermany, reliant like other EU states on Russian energy and more engaged in Russian trade than the United States, has been reluctant to escalate a confrontation with Moscow that has revived memories of the Cold War. But with military action not seen as an option, economic leverage is a vital instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN RETALIATION\r\n\r\nRussia said on Saturday it was retaliating against sanctions imposed by the United States last week, before the air disaster, by barring entry to unnamed Americans and warned of a \"boomerang effect\" on U.S. business. But Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry did agree in a phone call to try and get both sides in Ukraine to reach a consensus on peace.\r\n\r\nDriving home its assertion that the Boeing 777 was hit by a Russian SA-11 radar-guided missile, Ukraine\'s Western-backed government said it had \"compelling evidence\" the battery was not just brought in from Russia but manned by three Russian citizens who had now taken the truck-mounted system back over the border.\r\n\r\nThe prime minister, denying Russian suggestions that Kiev\'s forces had fired a missile, said only a \"very professional\" crew could have brought down the speeding jetliner from 33,000 feet - not \"drunken gorillas\" among the ill-trained insurgents who want the Russian-speaking east to be annexed by Moscow.\r\n\r\nFighting flared in eastern Ukraine on Saturday. The government said it was pressing its offensive in the east.\r\n\r\nObservers from Europe\'s OSCE security agency visited part of the crash site near the village of Hrabove for a second day on Saturday and again found their access hampered by armed men from the forces of the self-declared People\'s Republic of Donetsk. An OSCE official said, however, they saw more than on Friday.\r\n\r\nAt one point, a Reuters correspondent heard a senior rebel tell the OSCE delegation they could not approach the wreckage and would simply be informed in due course of an investigation conducted by the separatists. However, fighters later let them visit an area where one of the airliner\'s two engines lay.\r\n\r\n\"The terrorists, with the help of Russia, are trying to destroy evidence of international crimes,\" the Ukrainian government said in a statement. \"The terrorists have taken 38 bodies to the morgue in Donetsk,\" it said, accusing people with \"strong Russian accents\" of threatening to conduct autopsies.\r\n\r\nUkraine\'s prime minister said armed men had barred government experts from collecting evidence.\r\n\r\nUkraine\'s President Petro Poroshenko urged the United Nations on Saturday to label rebels fighting his forces in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk as belonging to \"terrorist organizations\".\r\n\r\n\r\nRETRIEVING REMAINS\r\n\r\nIn the regional capital Donetsk, the prime minister of the separatist authorities told a news conference that Kiev was holding up the arrival of international experts whose mission to probe the cause - and potentially blame - for the disaster was authorized on Friday by the United Nations Security Council.\r\n\r\nAnd contrary to earlier statements by the rebels, Alexander Borodai said they had not found the black box flight recorders. He said rebels were avoiding disturbing the area.\r\n\r\n\"There\'s a grandmother. A body landed right in her bed. She says \'please take this body away\'.

Moscow denies involvement and has pointed a finger at Kiev\'s military.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch government, whose citizens made up more than half the 298 aboard MH17 from Amsterdam, said it was \"furious\" at the manhandling of corpses strewn for miles over open country and asked Ukraine\'s president for help to bring \"our people\" home.\r\n\r\nAfter U.S. President Barack Obama said the loss of the Kuala Lumpur-bound flight showed it was time to end the conflict, Germany called it Moscow\'s last chance to cooperate.\r\n\r\nEuropean powers seemed to swing behind Washington\'s belief Russia\'s separatist allies were to blame. That might speed new trade sanctions on Moscow, without waiting for definitive proof.\r\n\"He has one last chance to show he means to help,\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said after a telephone call to Putin.\r\n\r\nBritain, which lost 10 citizens, said Prime Minister David Cameron agreed with Rutte that the European Union, warier than Washington of hurting its own economy by imposing sanctions, should reconsider its approach due to evidence of rebel guilt. On Friday, Cameron had urged caution before an investigation.\r\n\r\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, the most powerful figure in the EU, spoke to Putin on Saturday, urging his cooperation. Merkel\'s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, told Bild am Sonntag newspaper: \"Moscow may have a last chance now to show that it really is seriously interested in a solution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now is the moment for everyone to stop and think to themselves what might happen if we don\'t stop the escalation.\"\r\n\r\nGermany, reliant like other EU states on Russian energy and more engaged in Russian trade than the United States, has been reluctant to escalate a confrontation with Moscow that has revived memories of the Cold War. But with military action not seen as an option, economic leverage is a vital instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN RETALIATION\r\n\r\nRussia said on Saturday it was retaliating against sanctions imposed by the United States last week, before the air disaster, by barring entry to unnamed Americans and warned of a \"boomerang effect\" on U.S. business. But Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry did agree in a phone call to try and get both sides in Ukraine to reach a consensus on peace.\r\n\r\nDriving home its assertion that the Boeing 777 was hit by a Russian SA-11 radar-guided missile, Ukraine\'s Western-backed government said it had \"compelling evidence\" the battery was not just brought in from Russia but manned by three Russian citizens who had now taken the truck-mounted system back over the border.\r\n\r\nThe prime minister, denying Russian suggestions that Kiev\'s forces had fired a missile, said only a \"very professional\" crew could have brought down the speeding jetliner from 33,000 feet - not \"drunken gorillas\" among the ill-trained insurgents who want the Russian-speaking east to be annexed by Moscow.\r\n\r\nFighting flared in eastern Ukraine on Saturday. The government said it was pressing its offensive in the east.\r\n\r\nObservers from Europe\'s OSCE security agency visited part of the crash site near the village of Hrabove for a second day on Saturday and again found their access hampered by armed men from the forces of the self-declared People\'s Republic of Donetsk. An OSCE official said, however, they saw more than on Friday.\r\n\r\nAt one point, a Reuters correspondent heard a senior rebel tell the OSCE delegation they could not approach the wreckage and would simply be informed in due course of an investigation conducted by the separatists. However, fighters later let them visit an area where one of the airliner\'s two engines lay.\r\n\r\n\"The terrorists, with the help of Russia, are trying to destroy evidence of international crimes,\" the Ukrainian government said in a statement. \"The terrorists have taken 38 bodies to the morgue in Donetsk,\" it said, accusing people with \"strong Russian accents\" of threatening to conduct autopsies.\r\n\r\nUkraine\'s prime minister said armed men had barred government experts from collecting evidence.\r\n\r\nUkraine\'s President Petro Poroshenko urged the United Nations on Saturday to label rebels fighting his forces in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk as belonging to \"terrorist organizations\".\r\n\r\n\r\nRETRIEVING REMAINS\r\n\r\nIn the regional capital Donetsk, the prime minister of the separatist authorities told a news conference that Kiev was holding up the arrival of international experts whose mission to probe the cause - and potentially blame - for the disaster was authorized on Friday by the United Nations Security Council.\r\n\r\nAnd contrary to earlier statements by the rebels, Alexander Borodai said they had not found the black box flight recorders. He said rebels were avoiding disturbing the area.\r\n\r\n\"There\'s a grandmother. A body landed right in her bed. She says \'please take this body away\'. But we cannot tamper with the site,\" Borodai said. \"Bodies of innocent people are lying out in the heat.

Moscow and the separatists deny those allegations.\r\n\r\nThe Pentagon said yesterday that Russia was ready to move advanced missile systems across the Ukrainian border to the rebels very soon, and “potentially today.”\r\n\r\n“We have indications that the Russians intend to supply heavier and more sophisticated multiple-launch rocket systems in the very near future,” said US army colonel Steve Warren.\r\n\r\n“We believe that they are able to transfer this equipment at any time, at any moment.”\r\n\r\nCol Warren also said “for several days, Russian forces using Russian artillery from Russian soil have conducted attacks against Ukrainian military positions . . . This is unquestionably an escalation from a military perspective.”\r\n\r\nWashington’s backing for Ukrainian claims of Russia firing shells across the border drew a furious reaction from Moscow, which said the US must share the blame for bloodshed in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nRussia’s foreign ministry said the US was conducting a “smear campaign” of “unfounded public insinuations” and “anti-Russian cliches”.\r\nIt also said Washington had backed the “coup” that overthrew pro-Kremlin president Viktor Yanukovich in February, and was encouraging Ukraine to engage in “cruel reprisals” against Russian-speakers who opposed Kiev’s new government.\r\n\r\n“Washington fully shares the responsibility for the bloodshed. The US administration should not lay the blame on somebody else,” it said.\r\n“It would be more honest and responsible to keep quiet if recognising the truth is difficult,” it added.\r\n\r\nAs Ukraine’s leaders tried to avert political crisis following Thursday’s collapse of the ruling coalition and resignation of pro-EU premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk, they also faced more serious accusations from Russia about alleged cross-border shelling.\r\n\r\nMoscow’s investigative committee said Ukraine had fired mortars with deadly intent at officials examining claims of previous shelling.\r\n','The United States has accused Russia of massing troops near Ukraine and preparing to give a high-tech missile system to separatist rebels fighting there, as Moscow and Kiev traded allegations of shelling each other’s territory.','2014-08-19 16:24:40',NULL,NULL,NULL),(134,131,'b06ab769d935d6ff07f9181a68dd26cc','Hamas spokesperson: We deported foreign journalists for filming missile launches','Hamas spokesperson Isra Al-Mudallal, said in a TV interview on Friday that journalists who filmed “places from where missiles were launched” were forced by security personnel to stop or leave the Gaza Strip.\r\n\r\nAccording to a new report by MEMRI (the Middle East Media Research Institute, Mudallal, told the Lebanese TV station Mayadeen TV by Skype that some journalists “would focus on filming the places from where missiles were launched.”\r\n\r\n“Thus, they were collaborating with the occupation,” said Mudallal, the head of foreign relations in the Hamas Information Ministry.\r\n\r\n“These journalists were deported from the Gaza Strip.
