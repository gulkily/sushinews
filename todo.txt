* figure out the threshold at which a story should be taken out of rotation
    * and how to do it
* flesh out the initial setup with minimum intervention
    * database config
    * cache location
    * mirror location
    * file permissions
* continue testing fresh install process
* moderation tokens
    * database or hash-based?
    * weights
* aggregate moderation
    * find most similar moderators
    * adjust their scores
    * should be easier to do since we have voter ids already
    * maybe something like this:
        * select "root" voter
        * calculate weight of every other voter based on similarity
